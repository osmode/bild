How to use bilder:

1. Set up a MySQL database and update the 'settings.py' file with the corresponding database name, username, and password.

2. Train the software:
	a. Put jpeg files in the folder 'sourceimages'
	b. Put DICOM files in the folder 'xsourceimages'
	c. Start the Django development server (or run your production server)	
	b. Go to 'localhost:8000/remember' (or 'localhost:8000/xremember') to compress the images and store them in your MySQL database

3. The input image(s) should be put in the folder 'inputimage' (if JPEG) or 'xinputimage' (if DICOM). 

4. Go to 'localhost:8000/detect/' (if using input JPEGS) or 'localhost:8000/xdetect/' (if using input DICOM). A marked image named 'input.marked'
will be created the 'markedimage' folder.
